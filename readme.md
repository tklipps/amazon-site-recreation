# This is a heading (h1)

## This is a smaller heading (h2)

### A Smaller heading (h3)

#### Yet a smaller heading - make sure to use space after # for compatibililty

##### And a smaller heading, still - we can use ctrl-shift-v to use default markdown viewer in VS Code

###### Six down, just like html - always use line breaks after headings

I am a paragraph. Do not indent me. Just write here. To start writing on a new line, add trailing white space - aka 3 spaces at the end of the line   
like so   anow I am on a new line. This

Or we can leave a full space between line to star a new paragraph or we can even use HTML in markdown and use the '<br>' tag:<br>I am on a new line</br>
You can write in **bold** or *italics* or ***both*** at the same time. This

    We can even put our text in boxes with an indent!

##Lists
We can make ordered lists:
1. item 1
2. item 2

The numbering does not matter as long as you start with one

1. is 1
2. is two
2. is three
7. is four

We can make an unordered list:
- first item
- second item
- third item

## HR
We can make a horizontal rule
<hr>

There are more options you can learn like embedding these elements inside each other, making footnotes, task lists, definition lists etc. If you want to learn more about markdown visit:
[Markdown Home Page](https://www.markdownguide.org/)

There is also an extended syntac that is available in many markdown
